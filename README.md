# Face Mask Detection using SVM

This project demonstrates a simple face mask detection system using an SVM (Support Vector Machine) classifier. The SVM model is trained to detect whether a person is wearing a mask or not. The project utilizes OpenCV for image processing and scikit-learn for building the SVM model.

- `svm_mask_detection.py`: The SVM model code for face mask detection.
- `svm_model.py`: The trained SVM model (to be generated after training).
- `README.md`: This documentation file.

## Usage

This project provides a basic demonstration of face mask detection using a simple SVM model. To run the code and see the detection in action:

1. Prepare your dataset by organizing images of people with and without masks in the `dataset` folder.
2. Adjust the SVM code in `svm_mask_detection.py` as needed.
3. Run `svm_mask_detection.py` using a Python interpreter.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3
- OpenCV (`pip install opencv-python`)
- scikit-learn (`pip install scikit-learn`)
